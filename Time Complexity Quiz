Question 1 :
What is the running time complexity of the following code snippet?

int value = 0;
for(int i=0; i < n; i++)
for(int j=0; j < i; j++)
value += 1;

Ans: n(n-1)/2

Question 2 :
Consider the following functions:

f(n) = 
g(n) = n!
h(n) = n

Which of the following statements about the asymptotic behavior of f(n), g(n), and h(n) is true?

Ans: h(n) = O(f(n)); g(n) = â„¦ (f(n))
